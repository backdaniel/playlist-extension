# playlist-extension

This is similar to a base structure for a browser extension so just importing it should be easy. (check the steps for your browser)

As for the `pages/` directory it contains a webpage that needs be hosted on the web, for testing purposes it is already hosted at https://backdaniel.com/playlist

This repo is probably going to be deleted in the future, if you want to keep it fork it before it's too late.
